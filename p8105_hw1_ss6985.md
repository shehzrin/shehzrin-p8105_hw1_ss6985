P8105 Homework 1
================

## Problem 1:

### Loading the penguin dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

### Description of the penguins dataset

The ‘penguins’ dataset contains data about different penguin species. It
contains data on 344 penguins, with 8 variables that provide
measurements and characteristics of penguins. The dataset includes the
variables **species** (the type of penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap, or
Gentoo)), **island** (the island where the penguins were observed
(Torgersen, Biscoe, or Dream)), **bill_length_mm** (the length of the
penguin’s bill in millimeters), **bill_depth_mm** (the depth of the
penguin’s bill in millimeters), **flipper_length_mm** (the length of the
penguin’s flippers in millimeters), **body_mass_g** (the penguin’s body
mass in grams), **sex** (the sex of the penguin (male or female)), and
**year** (the year in which the penguins were observed).

The dataset has a total of 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper
length of the penguins is 200.92mm.

### Making a Scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).
