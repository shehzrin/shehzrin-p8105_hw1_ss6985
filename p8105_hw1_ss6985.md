P8105 Homework 1
================

## Problem 1:

### Loading the penguin dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

### Description of the penguins dataset

The ‘penguins’ dataset contains data about different penguin species. It
contains data on 344 penguins, with 8 variables that provide
measurements and characteristics of penguins. The dataset includes the
variables **species** (the type of penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap, or
Gentoo)), **island** (the island where the penguins were observed
(Torgersen, Biscoe, or Dream)), **bill_length_mm** (the length of the
penguin’s bill in millimeters), **bill_depth_mm** (the depth of the
penguin’s bill in millimeters), **flipper_length_mm** (the length of the
penguin’s flippers in millimeters), **body_mass_g** (the penguin’s body
mass in grams), **sex** (the sex of the penguin (male or female)), and
**year** (the year in which the penguins were observed).

The dataset has a total of 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper
length of the penguins is 200.92mm.

### Making a scatterplot using the penguins dataset

``` r
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

``` r
ggsave("flipper_vs_bill_scatterplot.png", width = 6, height = 4)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

## Problem 2:

### Creating a dataframe

``` r
homework1_df = 
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(10),
    vec_logical = norm_samp > 0,
    vec_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E","F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
    vec_factor = factor(c("low", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high", "low"))
  )
print(homework1_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    norm_samp vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1    1.54   TRUE        A        low       
    ##  2   -0.322  FALSE       B        medium    
    ##  3   -1.37   FALSE       C        high      
    ##  4   -0.0777 FALSE       D        low       
    ##  5    0.636  TRUE        E        medium    
    ##  6   -1.67   FALSE       F        high      
    ##  7    0.693  TRUE        G        low       
    ##  8   -0.129  FALSE       H        medium    
    ##  9   -0.621  FALSE       I        high      
    ## 10   -0.804  FALSE       J        low

### Taking the mean of each variable in the dataframe

This works and provides the mean of the numeric vector.

``` r
mean(pull(homework1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.2122555

This works since the logical vector is treated as numeric (TRUE = 1 and
FALSE = 0).

``` r
mean(pull(homework1_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

This does not work since characters cannot be averaged (returns NA).

``` r
mean(pull(homework1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(homework1_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

This does not work since factors need to be converted to numeric if you
want to take their mean (returns NA).

``` r
mean(pull(homework1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(homework1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

### Converting variables from one type to another

``` r
converted_vec_logical = as.numeric(homework1_df$vec_logical)
converted_vec_char = as.numeric(homework1_df$vec_char)
converted_vec_factor = as.numeric(homework1_df$vec_factor)
```

The **logical** values are converted to numerical values (1 and 0).
Logical values are treated as numeric (TRUE becomes 1 and FALSE becomes
0), so taking the mean is straightforward. The **character** variable
conversion produces a warning (i.e., NAs introduced by coercion). I
assume characters cannot be converted to numeric values without some
more information, explaining why calculating the mean of a character
vector results in NA (there is no numeric data to average). Conversion
to numeric works by translating **factor** levels (non-numeric levels at
first) to integers (explains why you can calculate the mean of factors
if converted to numeric). However, the mean of these integer codes might
not be meaningful in a categorical context.
