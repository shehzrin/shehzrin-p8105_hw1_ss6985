P8105 Homework 1
================

## Problem 1:

### Loading the penguin dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

### Description of the penguins dataset

The ‘penguins’ dataset contains data about different penguin species. It
contains data on 344 penguins, with 8 variables that provide
measurements and characteristics of penguins. The dataset includes the
variables **species** (the type of penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap, or
Gentoo)), **island** (the island where the penguins were observed
(Torgersen, Biscoe, or Dream)), **bill_length_mm** (the length of the
penguin’s bill in millimeters), **bill_depth_mm** (the depth of the
penguin’s bill in millimeters), **flipper_length_mm** (the length of the
penguin’s flippers in millimeters), **body_mass_g** (the penguin’s body
mass in grams), **sex** (the sex of the penguin (male or female)), and
**year** (the year in which the penguins were observed).

The dataset has a total of 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper
length of the penguins is 200.92mm.

### Making a scatterplot using the penguins dataset

``` r
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

``` r
ggsave("flipper_vs_bill_scatterplot.png", width = 6, height = 4)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

## Problem 2:

### Creating a dataframe

``` r
homework1_df = 
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(10),
    vec_logical = norm_samp > 0,
    vec_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E","F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
    vec_factor = factor (rep(c("Low", "Medium", "High"), length.out = 10))
  )
print(homework1_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    norm_samp vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1    1.88   TRUE        A        Low       
    ##  2    0.371  TRUE        B        Medium    
    ##  3    0.0580 TRUE        C        High      
    ##  4    1.02   TRUE        D        Low       
    ##  5    0.161  TRUE        E        Medium    
    ##  6    0.692  TRUE        F        High      
    ##  7    0.482  TRUE        G        Low       
    ##  8    0.859  TRUE        H        Medium    
    ##  9   -1.24   FALSE       I        High      
    ## 10   -0.262  FALSE       J        Low

### Taking the mean of each variable in the dataframe

This works and provides the mean of the numeric vector.

``` r
mean(homework1_df %>% pull (norm_samp))  
```

    ## [1] 0.4023684

This works since the logical vector is treated as numeric (TRUE = 1 and
FALSE = 0).

``` r
mean(homework1_df %>% pull (vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.8

This does not work since characters cannot be averaged.

``` r
mean(homework1_df %>% pull (vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(homework1_df %>% pull(vec_char)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

This does not work since factors need to be converted to numeric if you
want to take their mean.

``` r
mean(homework1_df %>% pull (vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(homework1_df %>% pull(vec_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

### Converting variables from one type to another

``` r
converted_vec_logical = as.numeric(homework1_df$vec_logical)
converted_vec_char = as.numeric(homework1_df$vec_char)
converted_vec_factor = as.numeric(homework1_df$vec_factor)
```

The **logical** values are converted to numerical values (1 and 0).
Logical values are treated as numeric (TRUE becomes 1 and FALSE becomes
0), so taking the mean is straightforward. The **character** variable
conversion produces a warning (i.e., NAs introduced by coercion). I
assume characters cannot be converted to numeric values without some
more information, explaining why calculating the mean of a character
vector results in NA (there is no numeric data to average). Conversion
to numeric works by translating **factor** levels to integers (explains
why you can calculate the mean of factors if converted to numeric).
However, the mean of these integer codes might not be meaningful in a
categorical context.
