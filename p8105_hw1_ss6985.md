P8105 Homework 1
================

## Problem 1:

### Loading the penguin dataset

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

### Description of the penguins dataset

The ‘penguins’ dataset contains data about different penguin species. It
contains data on 344 penguins, with 8 variables that provide
measurements and characteristics of penguins. The dataset includes the
variables **species** (the type of penguin (Adelie, Chinstrap, or
Gentoo)), **island** (the island where the penguins were observed
(Torgersen, Biscoe, or Dream)), **bill_length_mm** (the length of the
penguin’s bill in millimeters), **bill_depth_mm** (the depth of the
penguin’s bill in millimeters), **flipper_length_mm** (the length of the
penguin’s flippers in millimeters), **body_mass_g** (the penguin’s body
mass in grams), **sex** (the sex of the penguin (male or female)), and
**year** (the year in which the penguins were observed).

The dataset has a total of 344 rows and 8 columns. The mean flipper
length of the penguins is 200.92mm.

### Making a scatterplot using the penguins dataset

``` r
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

``` r
ggsave("flipper_vs_bill_scatterplot.png", width = 6, height = 4)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range
    ## (`geom_point()`).

## Problem 2:

### Creating a dataframe

``` r
homework1_df = 
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(10),
    vec_logical = norm_samp > 0,
    vec_char = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E","F", "G", "H", "I", "J"),
    vec_factor = factor (rep(c("Low", "Medium", "High"), length.out = 10))
  )
print(homework1_df)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    norm_samp vec_logical vec_char vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1    -0.844 FALSE       A        Low       
    ##  2     1.42  TRUE        B        Medium    
    ##  3     0.863 TRUE        C        High      
    ##  4     1.05  TRUE        D        Low       
    ##  5     2.00  TRUE        E        Medium    
    ##  6     1.29  TRUE        F        High      
    ##  7    -0.468 FALSE       G        Low       
    ##  8    -0.677 FALSE       H        Medium    
    ##  9    -0.690 FALSE       I        High      
    ## 10    -0.163 FALSE       J        Low

### Taking the mean of each variable in the dataframe

``` r
mean(homework1_df %>% pull (norm_samp))  
```

    ## [1] 0.3778639

This works and provides the mean of the numeric vector.

``` r
mean(homework1_df %>% pull (vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.5

This works since the logical vector is treated as numeric (TRUE = 1 and
FALSE = 0).

``` r
mean(homework1_df %>% pull (vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(homework1_df %>% pull(vec_char)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

This does not work since characters cannot be averaged.

``` r
mean(homework1_df %>% pull (vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(homework1_df %>% pull(vec_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

This does not work since factors need to be converted to numeric if you
want to take their mean.
